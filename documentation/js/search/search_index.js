SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY\n1. Crowd Works India Foundation Team is committed to ensuring that it maintains ethical business practices, complies with applicable law and its crowdfunding platform is not used for funding illegal activities. To achieve this objective we have prepared this Anti-Money Laundering Policy (“AML Policy”) and request you to carefully read and follow the policy. This policy is in addition to your obligations under applicable laws on the prevention of money laundering and does not detract in any manner from those obligations. We urge you to be aware of your obligations under such applicable laws. Crowd Works India Foundation’s ability to comply with its obligations under applicable law is dependent on your cooperation and we seek your cooperation via this policy.\n2. To ensure that we are not involved in any transactions that are known or suspected to be means of laundering money if any suspicious activity is noticed, users of the Crowd Works India Foundation platform are urged to promptly contact government authorities to facilitate any action that may be needed.\n3. This money laundering policy applies to all persons using and accessing Crowd Works India Foundation’s platform. This includes all donors, contributors, campaigners, and persons visiting our platform. All these persons are collectively referred to as “Users” or “users”.\n\nII. WHAT CONSTITUTES MONEY LAUNDERING AND SUSPICIOUS\n  TRANSACTIONS\n  \n1. “Money laundering” is largely understood to mean any act or attempt (directly or indirectly and even by association in one step of a series of transactions) to conceal or disguise the origin and ownership of proceeds obtained illegally, such that it appears to have originated from legitimate sources; thus avoiding prosecution, conviction and confiscation of such proceeds. Terrorist organisations, tax evaders, smugglers, persons involved in bribery or any persons that receive money for illegal activities and/or through illegal means may launder money.\n2.
