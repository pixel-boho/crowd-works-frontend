&lt;h6&gt;&lt;u&gt;I. SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Crowd Works India Foundation Team is committed to ensuring that it maintains ethical business practices, complies with applicable law and its crowdfunding platform is not used for funding illegal activities. To achieve this objective we have prepared this Anti-Money Laundering Policy (“AML Policy”) and request you to carefully read and follow the policy. This policy is in addition to your obligations under applicable laws on the prevention of money laundering and does not detract in any manner from those obligations. We urge you to be aware of your obligations under such applicable laws. Crowd Works India Foundation’s ability to comply with its obligations under applicable law is dependent on your cooperation and we seek your cooperation via this policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. To ensure that we are not involved in any transactions that are known or suspected to be means of laundering money if any suspicious activity is noticed, users of the Crowd Works India Foundation platform are urged to promptly contact government authorities to facilitate any action that may be needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. This money laundering policy applies to all persons using and accessing Crowd Works India Foundation’s platform. This includes all donors, contributors, campaigners, and persons visiting our platform. All these persons are collectively referred to as “Users” or “users”.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;u&gt;II. WHAT CONSTITUTES MONEY LAUNDERING AND SUSPICIOUS
  TRANSACTIONS
  &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. “Money laundering” is largely understood to mean any act or attempt (directly or indirectly and even by association in one step of a series of transactions) to conceal or disguise the origin and ownership of proceeds obtained illegally, such that it appears to have originated from legitimate sources; thus avoiding prosecution, conviction and confiscation of such proceeds. Terrorist organisations, tax evaders, smugglers, persons involved in bribery or any persons that receive money for illegal activities and/or through illegal means may launder money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Recognising transactions involving money laundering requires awareness of possible suspicious activity, which may arise at any time. Below is an indicative list of actions that persons associated with Crowd Works India Foundation should be careful of. This list is not exhaustive, as every circumstance is not foreseeable. However, regardless of appearing together or individually, please be aware of the following situations that may be indications of money laundering activity:

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(i)	Users that are reluctant to provide complete information, or those that provide incomplete, false or suspicious information and/ or are unwilling to comply with Crowd Works India Foundation’s identification requirements;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(ii)	Users that appear as agents or representatives for other individuals or organisations, but refuse to provide complete information about such individuals or organisations;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(iii)	Any person, including a Crowd Works India Foundation employee, that is concerned about or seeks to avoid any reporting requirements or refuses to maintain required records;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(iv)	Payments made in cash or cash equivalents only (such as money orders, traveller’s cheques, internet currencies or prepaid cash cards);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(v)	Donations of large amounts that appear to be out of place or inconsistent with normal donation patterns, in the absence of any legitimate requirement for such donation;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(vi)	Requests for payments to be made in unrelated countries or to third parties;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(vii)	Multiple partial payments from various parties on behalf of a single user and/or multiple partial payments from various locations;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(viii)	Users making payments in one form, then requesting refunds in other forms (for example, making payments by credit card, but requesting refunds in cash or by wire transfers);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(ix)	Users making contributions, followed by immediate requests to wire out or transfer the funds to a third party or firm, without connected purposes;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(x)	Users requesting for donations to be paid in cash or wired to a third party or firm, without connected purposes;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(xi)	On-boarding of users by Crowd Works India Foundation employees based on incomplete information or in contravention of Crowd Works India Foundation’s policies;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(xii)	Acceptance of incentives by a Crowd Works India Foundation employee for breaching Crowd Works India Foundation’s policies;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(xiii)	Users connected to countries and/ or persons identified as non- cooperative by the Reserve Bank of India, Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering established by the G-7 Summit in 1987, Office of Foreign Assets Control, US Department of Treasury and international organisations against money laundering.
&lt;/p&gt;

To achieve this objective we have prepared this Anti-Money Laundering Policy (“AML Policy”) and request you to carefully read and follow the policy. This policy is in addition to your obligations under applicable laws on the prevention of money laundering and does not detract in any manner from those obligations. We urge you to be aware of your obligations under such applicable laws. Crowd Works India Foundation’s ability to comply with its obligations under applicable law is dependent on your cooperation and we seek your cooperation via this policy.</p><p>2.

WHAT CONSTITUTES MONEY LAUNDERING AND SUSPICIOUS  TRANSACTIONS  </u></h6><p>1. “Money laundering” is largely understood to mean any act or attempt (directly or indirectly and even by association in one step of a series of transactions) to conceal or disguise the origin and ownership of proceeds obtained illegally, such that it appears to have originated from legitimate sources; thus avoiding prosecution, conviction and confiscation of such proceeds. Terrorist organisations, tax evaders, smugglers, persons involved in bribery or any persons that receive money for illegal activities and/or through illegal means may launder money.</p><p>2. Recognising transactions involving money laundering requires awareness of possible suspicious activity, which may arise at any time. Below is an indicative list of actions that persons associated with Crowd Works India Foundation should be careful of. This list is not exhaustive, as every circumstance is not foreseeable. However, regardless of appearing together or individually, please be aware of the following situations that may be indications of money laundering activity:</p><p>(i)	Users that are reluctant to provide complete information, or those that provide incomplete, false or suspicious information and/ or are unwilling to comply with Crowd Works India Foundation’s identification requirements;</p><p>(ii)	Users that appear as agents or representatives for other individuals or organisations, but refuse to provide complete information about such individuals or organisations;</p><p>(iii)	Any person, including a Crowd Works India Foundation employee, that is concerned about or seeks to avoid any reporting requirements or refuses to maintain required records;</p><p>(iv)	Payments made in cash or cash equivalents only (such as money orders, traveller’s cheques, internet currencies or prepaid cash cards);</p><p>(v)	Donations of large amounts that appear to be out of place or inconsistent with normal donation patterns, in the absence of any legitimate requirement for such donation;</p><p>(vi)	Requests for payments to be made in unrelated countries or to third parties;</p><p>(vii)	Multiple partial payments from various parties on behalf of a single user and/or multiple partial payments from various locations;</p><p>(viii)	Users making payments in one form, then requesting refunds in other forms (for example, making payments by credit card, but requesting refunds in cash or by wire transfers);</p><p>(ix)	Users making contributions, followed by immediate requests to wire out or transfer the funds to a third party or firm, without connected purposes;</p><p>(x)	Users requesting for donations to be paid in cash or wired to a third party or firm, without connected purposes;</p><p>(xi)	On-boarding of users by Crowd Works India Foundation employees based on incomplete information or in contravention of Crowd Works India Foundation’s policies;</p><p>(xii)	Acceptance of incentives by a Crowd Works India Foundation employee for breaching Crowd Works India Foundation’s policies;</p><p>(xiii)	Users connected to countries and/ or persons identified as non- cooperative by the Reserve Bank of India, Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering established by the G-7 Summit in 1987, Office of Foreign Assets Control, US Department of Treasury and international organisations against money laundering.</p><p><u>III.
